\section{What is a Vector?}\label{sec:vectors}

\subsection{Vector Interpretations}

\subsubsection{Physics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vectors are arrows pointing in space, defined only by its length and direction 
    \item The point or origin doesn't matter
    \item can be two dimensional or three dimensional
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Computer Science}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vectors are ordered lists of numbers
    \item Vector is almost synonymous with "list" in CS
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mathematics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A vector is anything where there's a sensible notion of adding two vectors or multiplying them by a scalar
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coordinate Systems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Coordinates of a vector are numbers, giving instructions from getting from the tail at the origin to its tip
    \item Each entry in the vector represents movement along a specific axis / direction
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vector Operations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Addition}: Each vector represents a certain movement, so the sum is like moving in the direction of both vectors individually (you end up on the same point)
    $$
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x_1 \\
            y_1
        \end{bmatrix} +
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x_2 \\
            y_2
        \end{bmatrix} =
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x_1 + x_2 \\
            y_1 + y_2
        \end{bmatrix}
    $$
    \item \textbf{Scaling}: Think of it as "stretching" or "squeezing" a vector by a scalar. Negative signs "flip" the vector around
    $$
    2 \bf{v} = 2 \cdot  
    \begin{bmatrix}
         x \\ 
         y 
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix} 
            2x \\ 
            2y
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$ 
\end{itemize}
