\section{Matrix Multiplication}
\subsection{Recap}
\begin{itemize}
    \item linear transformations: functions with vectors as inputs and outputs
    \item transform space in a way that keeps gridlines parallel, evenly spaced
    \item columns of a matrix represent how each basis vector is transformed
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Composition of Transformations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Composition: applying one transformation after another
    \item can compute a composition with two matrix-vector multiplies
    $$ AB = C \rightarrow A(Bv) = C(v) $$
    \item \textbf{Multiplying two matrices has the geometric meaning of applying one transformation after another.}
    $$ \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1 \\
    0 & 1 
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & -1 \\
    1 & 0 
    \end{bmatrix}
    \item 
\end{itemize}
