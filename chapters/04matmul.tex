\section{Matrix Multiplication}
\subsection{Recap}
\begin{itemize}
    \item linear transformations: functions with vectors as inputs and outputs
    \item transform space in a way that keeps gridlines parallel, evenly spaced
    \item columns of a matrix represent how each basis vector is transformed
\end{itemize}
